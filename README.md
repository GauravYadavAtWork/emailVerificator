## Introduction

Welcome to the Authentication (2FA) via Email template for web applications. This project provides a simple and customizable solution for adding two-factor authentication to your web application, using email to deliver one-time passwords (OTPs) for user verification.

2FA is a crucial security feature that enhances user authentication by requiring users to provide a second piece of evidence (in this case, an OTP sent via email) in addition to their password, adding an extra layer of security to your website.

This template is designed to be easy to integrate into your web application, allowing you to quickly implement 2FA without having to build the entire system from scratch. It leverages email services to send OTPs, ensuring that users are using their original email addresses for verification.
